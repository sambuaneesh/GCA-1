He developed the concept of the \"Grabau Zone\", which is a sequence of strata that can be used to identify a particular geological period. He also developed the concept of the \"Grabau Index\", which is a measure of the relative age of a rock formation.\n\nGrabau was also a prolific writer, publishing more than 200 scientific papers and books. He wrote extensively on the geology of China, and his work was instrumental in the development of Chinese geology. He was also a proponent of the theory of continental drift, and his work helped to lay the foundations for modern plate tectonics.",
