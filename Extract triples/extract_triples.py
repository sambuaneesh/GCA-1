Given a piece of text, please extract all knowledge triples contained in the text, and represent the triples in the form of ("head entity", "relationship", "tail entity").\
    Note that the extracted triples need to be as fine-grained as possible. It is necessary to ensure that the semantics of the triple are consistent with the information in the corresponding part of the text and there is not a pronoun in the triple.  All knowledge triples in the text need to be extracted\
